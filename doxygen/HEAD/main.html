<h3 class="version">1.1.0-58-gb6da </h3><h2><a class="anchor" id="sec_intro"></a>
Introduction</h2>
<p>This library implements a modular architecture to test and experiment controllers in the Stack of Tasks Framework as defined in <a class="el" href="main.html#Mansard2007">Mansard2007</a>. It is specifically targeted to retain real-time performance while having high level software capabilities, like plugins and scripts.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="sec_organization"></a>
Organization of the code</h2>
<p>The code is based on the dynamic-graph package, which provides the framework from which sot-core relies. Hence most of the code in sot-core consists of classes that derive from entities. These entities are usually compiled and linked in their own dynamic library, as a "plugin"; hence you may choose to include (load) in your program only the ones you need.</p>
<p>Aside from the entities, there is a code base to the library, libsot-core, that provides functions and code common to all modules. All plugins developed here link with libsot-core. For example, common mathematical entities, definitions and functions are in that library's base. See <a class="el" href="a00187.html">Sot-core base library (libsot-core.[dll|so])</a> for a list of what's in this code base.</p>
<p>This library implements </p>

</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="using"></a>
Using the Stack of Tasks</h2>
<p>Using dynamic-graph objects (pool and factory), either through C++ code or the built-in interpreter, we can For people who develop software on the HRP2 robot, this package alone is insufficient to simulate and control a robot.</p>
<p>The following packages are recommended* in that case: </p>
<ul>
<li>sot-dynamic </li>
<li>sot-pattern-generator </li>
<li>sot-openhrp (openhrp plugin) </li>
<li>sot-openhrp-scripts</li>
</ul>
<p>These packages are in development at the time of writing and may be separated or joined along the way. Please check their status and updates at the jrl-umi3218 web page: <a href="https://github.com/jrl-umi3218">https://github.com/jrl-umi3218</a></p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="sec_RequirementsInstallation"></a>
Requirements and Installation</h2>
<p>This package should be compiled and installed with cmake.</p>
<p>This library is based on several packages: </p>
<ul>
<li>dynamic-graph (<a href="https://github.com/jrl-umi3218/dynamic-graph">https://github.com/jrl-umi3218/dynamic-graph</a>) </li>
<li>MatrixAbstractLayer (<a href="https://github.com/jrl-umi3218/jrl-mal">https://github.com/jrl-umi3218/jrl-mal</a>) </li>
<li>Lapack </li>
<li>Boost </li>
<li>pthread</li>
</ul>
<p>Their presence will be checked with the use of pkg-config.</p>
<p>There are talks of open-sourcing the library on github. When this is done, installation instructions will be on the project's github page.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="sot_base"></a>
Base library</h2>
<p>This package is centered around a base library that implements the basic classes needed for operation of the stack of tasks. For more information, see <a class="el" href="a00187.html">Sot-core base library (libsot-core.[dll|so])</a>.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="sot_plugins"></a>
Plugins</h2>
<p>While the main library provides a basic framework for computation of a control law using the Stack of Tasks, it is not expressive enough for typical usage scenarios (for example, controlling the humanoid robot HRP-2). Hence, several "specialized" features and tasks have been developed, and can be used in the Stack of Tasks. For a list of plugins and a short description, see <a class="el" href="a00188.html">List of plugins</a>.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="operation"></a>
Operation of the stack of tasks</h2>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="subsec_intro"></a>
Introduction</h3>
<p>As explained in <a class="el" href="main.html#Mansard2007">Mansard2007</a>, tasks can be pushed on the stack of tasks (SoT), and thus assigned a priority. The SoT then calculates (in an iterative manner) the control law, or joint velocity, necessary to realize the tasks (usually, bring a feature to its desired value).</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="tasks"></a>
Tasks</h3>
<p>Each task implements a specific controller which can be a free space task, visual servoing, a constraint, and so on ... a task is mainly defined by the feature it is handling and its gain.</p>
<p>After being defined, tasks are pushed in the Stack of Tasks which then calculates a control law as explained in <a class="el" href="main.html#Mansard2007">Mansard2007</a>.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="features"></a>
Features</h3>
<p>Each feature computes some information from measurements, from the robot state,or/and from others features. Features should be lightweight regarding computation and be included at this level only if necessary.</p>
